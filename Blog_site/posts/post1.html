        The Witcher 4 has been officially confirmed, and although we're quite
        excited, we certainly aren't surprised. There have been no shortage of
        rumors about another Witcher game by CD Projekt Red, and the studio has
        commented on the possibility multiple times. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is
        one of the greatest RPGs of all time(opens in new tab), so an eventual
        sequel has always made sense. Now that we know it's definitely in the
        works, we’ve gathered everything we know for sure about the next Witcher
        game, along with some educated speculation about which characters could
        return and what kind of story it might tell. CD Projekt Red's latest big
        RPG, Cyberpunk 2077 has been out now for some time and seems like it
        might be occupying the studio's attention for a while yet. The rocky
        launch was plagued with bugs, leading CDPR to work through a 2021
        roadmap for fixes. The company is also still working on DLCs for
        Cyberpunk. Project Polaris is the next Witcher game codename and it'll
        be "a story-driven open-world RPG built on the legacy of The Witcher 3:
        Wild Hunt", which hopefully makes the Lambert and Keira school rumours
        ring true. Polaris is the beginning of a new Witcher trilogy, with all
        three being delivered within a six-year period which, honestly, I can't
        wait for. With that in mind, let's take a look at everything we know
        about the next Witcher game.

      <h3>The Witcher 4 is the start of a new trilogy</h3>
      <p>
        During a CD Projekt Red financial earnings call in September 2022, CEO
        Adam Kiciński indicated that the next Witcher sequel could be the first
        in a new trilogy of Witcher games. "We said that there will be a new
        saga. We have in mind more than one," Kiciński said. "The first saga was
        three games, so now we are thinking about more than one game." Kiciński
        went on to describe the potential new series as "the second Witcher
        saga," leaving a pretty firm impression that CD Projekt is still in for
        the long haul on the Witcher. What the structure of that new saga will
        look like, and whether it'll be based on any earlier Witcher works or
        something more original, remains to be seen. We know a trilogy in the
        works alongside Project Sirius and Project Canis Majoris, two standalone
        Witcher projects.

      <h3>The Witcher 4 is being made with Unreal Engine 5</h3>
      <p>
        Alongside confirmation of The Witcher 4's development, CDPR also
        explained that it had partnered with Epic Games to use its development
        engine for the next game. "It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the
        technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible
        phase as in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve
        and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release," CD Projekt Red
        CTO Paweł Zawodny said. Later, game director Jason Slama explained that
        a major factor in the decision was Unreal 5's open-world capabilities.
        Instead of continuing to adapt REDengine for the purpose, CDPR will be
        leaning on what Unreal 5 can already do. "Players can go in whatever
        direction they want, they can handle content in any order that they
        want, theoretically," Slama said. "To really encapsulate that, you need
        a really stable environment where you can be able to make changes with a
        high level of confidence that it's not going to break in 1,600 other
        places down the line."

      <h3>CDPR acquired Molasses Flood to work on something</h3>
      <p>
        In October 2021 we got news of CD Projekt acquiring studio Molasses
        Flood (responsible for Flame in the Flood) to work "in close
        cooperation" with developer CD Projekt Red on an "ambitious project"
        based on one of CDPR's existing properties. CDPR also confirmed that
        Molasses Flood won't be working on Cyberpunk 2077, and since there are
        only two choices with CDPR, that leaves The Witcher. CDPR has confirmed
        what Molasses is working on Project Sirius, and is creating "an
        innovative take on The Witcher universe". Nice!

      <h3>
        CD Projekt signed a new deal with Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski in
        2019
      </h3>
      <p>
        CD Projekt famously got the rights to make Witcher games for a flat
        up-front fee, which novelist Andrzej Sapkowski wasn't thrilled about
        after the games became enormously popular. Since 2018 the two parties
        have been negotiating a new deal, and in December 2019 they finally
        reached it(opens in new tab). The new agreement "solidifies and
        reinforces the company’s relationship with Mr. Andrzej Sapkowski—author
        of The Witcher saga." The most interesting quote, however, is this one:
        "The agreement confers new rights upon the Company and reaffirms its
        existing title to 'The Witcher' intellectual property in developing
        video games, graphic novels, board games and merchandise." That doesn't
        spell out that new videogames are on the way, but it's a sure sign that
        CD Projekt has a long-term interest in The Witcher.
